## Getting Started

Before running the project, you need to install all the dependencies and setup the environment variables:

- Run `npm install`;
- Create a `.env` file on the project root folder. The file only needs one env variable and you should name it `REACT_APP_API_URL`. Check the `.env-example` file for reference.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run test`

Launches the unit test (Jest + RTL) runner in the interactive mode.

### `npm run cypress`

Launches the E2E test (Cypress) runner in the interactive mode. **Remember:** cypress is configured to access the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) environment. You need to run the project with `npm start` before running `npm cypress`.
